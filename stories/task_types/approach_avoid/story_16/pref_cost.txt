1) you are tasked with bringing the main courses, so you must do more preparation than others
2) the grassy area where you would picnic is always packed with people and there is barely any room between groups
3) it is 100 degrees Fahrenheit outside
4) the ground is muddy from a rainstorm a few days ago
5) it will take you two hours to drive to the location (and two hours to return home)
6) there are no grills provided in the picnic area of the park
