1) because it is new, the lines have been really long because so many people are going to the park
2) the rides are far apart from each other, and you’ll have to do a lot of walking
3) just yesterday, you fell and scraped your knees so walking in the park will cause you pain
4) you don’t have comfortable walking shoes, so your feet might be tired
5) your phone is nearly out of storage, and you won’t be able to take photos
6) you have been saving up for a big purchase, so you will be on a budget that permits you from spending money freely on games and food
