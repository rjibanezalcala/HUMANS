    # object:
    tracker.subscribe(to=['gaze'])
    
    # The first input parameter is a constant that tells the SDK that it's gaze
    # data we want. There are other constants for the other types of data that you
    # can get from the eye tracker (see SDK reference guide for details).
    # The second parameter is the callback function that we just defined, and the
    # third parameter tells the SDK that we want the data as a dictionary.

# Tracker data format
# Gaze - (x, y) for each eye
# Pupil diam. - actual, internal physical size of the pupil and not the size it
#   appears to be when looking at the eye from the outside, estimated in mm,
#   both eyes)
# Eye openness -  the diameter in millimeters of the largest sphere that can be
#   fitted between the upper and lower eyelids. Upper and lower eyelids are
#   defined by the contrast lines between the sclera and the lashes/lid
#   structure. For each eye.
# Time - In the Tobii Pro SDK there are two kinds of time stamps: device time
#   stamp and system time stamp. The source of the device time stamp is the
#   internal clock in the eye tracker hardware while the system time stamp uses
#   the computer on which the application is running as the source.
#   Time stamps in the Tobii Pro SDK are generally given in microseconds.
# Validity codes - each individual kind of data relating to the eye is provided
#   with its own validity code which can only have one out of two possible
#   values: valid or invalid.
